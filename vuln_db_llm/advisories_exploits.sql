When an attacker crafts a URL fragment containing HTML tags like '#<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>', jQuery interprets this as a selector and creates DOM elements, executing any embedded JavaScript. The vulnerability is in jQuery's core selector functionality (exported), requires only JavaScript execution (no external files or specific HTML setup), and the payload is a simple string that can be controlled via URL fragments.

of untrusted code when passing HTML from untrusted sources to DOM manipulation methods. The vulnerability affects multiple jQuery DOM manipulation functions including .html(), .append(), .prepend(), .after(), .before(), and .replaceWith(). These functions are all exported and directly accessible from the jQuery library object. The attack vector involves passing malicious HTML strings containing JavaScript that gets executed when processed by jQuery's DOM manipulation methods, even after sanitization attempts. A classic XSS payload like '<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>' demonstrates the vulnerability. The workaround involves overriding jQuery.htmlPrefilter to return HTML unchanged, which suggests the vulnerability is in jQuery's HTML preprocessing logic that attempts to filter content but can be bypassed by malicious payloads. All identified functions have high confidence scores as they are explicitly mentioned in the vulnerability description as affected DOM manipulation methods."}, "severity": "MODERATE", "github_reviewed": true, "nvd_published_at": "2020-04-29T22:15:00Z", "github_reviewed_at": "2020-04-29T22:18:37Z"}}	2020-04-29 22:18:55+00	2025-01-31 20:49:05+00

The vulnerability affects multiple DOM manipulation methods including `.html()`, `.append()`, `.prepend()`, `.after()`, `.before()`, and `.replaceWith()`. The core issue is that jQuery's parsing of `<option>` elements allows script execution even after sanitization. I identified two primary PoCs covering the main DOM manipulation methods mentioned. The payloads use `<option>` elements containing embedded `<style>` and `<script>` tags, which is the typical pattern for this type of jQuery XSS vulnerability. Both methods are exported and directly accessible from the jQuery object. The confidence score is 0.8 because while the vulnerability description is clear about the affected methods and attack vector, specific payload examples weren't provided in the references, requiring inference based on the known vulnerability pattern for jQuery option-based XSS."}, "severity": "MODERATE", "github_reviewed": true, "nvd_published_at": "2020-04-29T21:15:00Z", "github_reviewed_at": "2020-04-29T21:04:50Z"}}	2020-04-29 22:19:14+00	2025-01-31 20:50:03+00

An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time.\\n\\nIf are you are using Highlight.js to highlight user-provided data you are possibly vulnerable.  On the client-side (in a browser or Electron environment) risks could include lengthy freezes or crashes... On the server-side infinite freezes could occur... effectively preventing users from accessing your app or service (ie, Denial of Service).\\n\\nThis is an issue with grammars shipped with the parser (and potentially 3rd party grammars also), not the parser itself. If you are using Highlight.js with any of the following grammars you are vulnerable.  If you are using `highlightAuto` to detect the language (and have any of these grammars registered) you are vulnerable. Exponential grammars (C, Perl, JavaScript) are auto-registered when using the common grammar subset/library `require('highlight.js/lib/common')` as of 10.4.0 - see https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/highlightjs/cdn-release@10.4.0/build/highlight.js\\n\\nAll versions prior to 10.4.1 are vulnerable, including version 9.18.5. \\n\\n**Grammars with exponential backtracking issues:**\\n\\n  - c-like (c, cpp, arduino)\\n  - handlebars (htmlbars)\\n  - gams\\n  - perl\\n  - jboss-cli\\n  - r\\n  - erlang-repl\\n  - powershell\\n  - routeros\\n  - livescript (10.4.0 and 9.18.5 included this fix)\\n  - javascript & typescript (10.4.0 included partial fixes)\\n\\nAnd of course any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `hpp` is no safer than `cpp`.\\n\\n**Grammars with polynomial backtracking issues:**\\n\\n- kotlin\\n- gcode\\n- d\\n- aspectj\\n- moonscript\\n- coffeescript/livescript\\n- csharp\\n- scilab\\n- crystal\\n- elixir\\n- basic\\n- ebnf\\n- ruby\\n- fortran/irpf90\\n- livecodeserver\\n- yaml\\n- x86asm\\n- dsconfig\\n- markdown\\n- ruleslanguage\\n- xquery\\n- sqf\\n\\nAnd again: any aliases of those languages have the same issue. ie: `ruby` and `rb` share the same ruby issues.\\n\\n\\n### Patches\\n\\n- Version 10.4.1 resolves these vulnerabilities.  Please upgrade.\\n\\n### Workarounds / Mitigations\\n\\n- Discontinue use the affected grammars. (or perhaps use only those with poly vs exponential issues)\\n- Attempt cherry-picking the grammar fixes into older versions...\\n- Attempt using newer CDN versions of any affected languages.

To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\\n \\n```js\\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\\n\\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\\n  } else {\\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\\n      searchKeyFound = true;\\n    }\\n  });\\n  return searchKeyFound;\\n};\\n\\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\"foo\\": \\"bar\\"}');\\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\"Doing dangerous thing as user.\\"\\n} else {\\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\\n}\\n```\\n \\nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\\n \\n```js\\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\"foo\\": \\"bar\\", \\"isAdmin\\": true}');\\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\\n} else {\\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\\n}\\n```\\n \\nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\\"isAdmin\\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\\n \\n```js\\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\\"foo\\": \\"bar\\", \\"__proto__\\": {\\"isAdmin\\": true}}');\\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \\"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\\"\\n} else {\\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\\n}\\n ```", "summary": "Prototype Pollution in JSON5 via Parse Method", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "ECOSYSTEM", "events": [{"introduced": "2.0.0"}, {"fixed": "2.2.2"}]}], "package": {"name": "json5", "ecosystem": "npm"}}, {"ranges": [{"type": "ECOSYSTEM", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "1.0.2"}]}], "package": {"name": "json5", "ecosystem": "npm"}}], "modified": "2024-02-13T21:31:39Z", "severity": [{"type": "CVSS_V3", "score": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H"}], "published": "2022-12-29T01:51:03Z", "references": [{"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46175", "type": "ADVISORY"}, {"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/298", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5/commit/62a65408408d40aeea14c7869ed327acead12972", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5/commit/7774c1097993bc3ce9f0ac4b722a32bf7d6871c8", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://github.com/json5/json5", "type": "PACKAGE"}, {"url": "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/11/msg00021.html", "type": "WEB"}, {"url": "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3S26TLPLVFAJTUN3VIXFDEBEXDYO22CE", "type": "WEB"}], "schema_version": "1.4.0", "database_specific": {"cwe_ids": ["CWE-1321"], "exploit": {"data": [{"poc": "LIBOBJ.parse(PAYLOAD)", "gadget": false, "payload": "{\\"__proto__\\": {\\"polluted\\": \\"yes\\"}}", "exported": true, "arguments": "", "exploited": true, "sink_type": "javascript", "validated": true, "payload_type": "string", "arguments_type": "", "additional_info": {}, "confidence_score": 0.95, "vulnerability_type": "pollution"}], "summary": "This analysis identified a prototype pollution vulnerability in JSON5.parse() where the __proto__ key is not properly restricted during parsing.

AngularJS users using JQuery should upgrade JQuery to 3.5.0, as a similar vulnerability [affects jQuery <3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2).\\n\\n### Workarounds\\nChanging sanitizer configuration not to allow certain tag grouping (e.g. `<option><style></option>`) or inline style elements may stop certain exploitation vectors, but it's uncertain if all possible exploitation vectors would be covered.

All use the same payload pattern exploiting the style tag transformation - the payload contains nested style tags where the self-closing `<style/>` gets expanded, closing the outer style element early and reactivating a malicious img element with onerror handler.

tooltip and popover plugins where the `data-template` attribute lacks proper input sanitization. The vulnerability requires an attacker to control the `data-template` attribute content on HTML elements that are later processed by Bootstrap's `.tooltip()` or `.popover()` methods. When these methods are called, the malicious template content gets executed as JavaScript. I identified two main attack vectors - one for tooltips and one for popovers, both following the same pattern where malicious HTML/JavaScript in the `data-template` attribute gets processed without sanitization. The sink type is 'html' because it requires controlling an HTML attribute, though the actual exploitation happens when the JavaScript methods process that HTML. Both tooltip() and popover() methods are exported and directly accessible from Bootstrap's main object, making this vulnerability easily exploitable in applications that allow user-controlled content in these attributes."}, "severity": "MODERATE", "github_reviewed": true, "nvd_published_at": "2019-02-20T16:29:00Z", "github_reviewed_at": "2020-06-16T21:29:39Z"}}	2019-02-22 20:54:47+00	2024-08-01 21:03:10+00

The vulnerability type is 'other' as it doesn't fit standard categories - it's a predictable value generation issue that could lead to HTTP parameter pollution.

The second PoC exploits the HTML tag parsing regex by providing malformed tags with repetitive attributes, triggering backtracking in patterns like `(?:\\"[^\\"]*\\"|'[^']*'|\\\\s[^'\\"/\\\\>\\\\s]*)*`.
